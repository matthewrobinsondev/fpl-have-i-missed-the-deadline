#This endpoint returns a JSON array which contains every fixture of the season.
#To get fixtures for specific Gameweek, you can add a parameter after the endpoint path (ex: fixtures?event=7).
#You can also request only the upcoming fixtures using future parameter (ex: fixtures?future=1).
#If you set the future value to 0, you will get all fixtures, but if 1 you will only get the upcoming fixtures. I see this parameter as a boolean value (future = true or false).
